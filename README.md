# meme_maker

## Overview
Hello there! This project, meme_maker, is a discord bot that allows you to take any message sent in a channel and automatically format it into a meme using the message id (available with discord dev mode). It features dynamic text resizing that allows even very long messages of hundreds of characters to be formatted while still looking normal. I made the bot using javascript, using the star library discord.js. It took about 12 hours over the span of 3 days of intensive programming and learning discord bot devlopment for the first time to create.

## Instructions
Since this bot is not powered by a hosting service of any kind (I'm broke), you will either need to message me in the demo server for me to activate it, or you can copy the code and create your own bot, replacing the token with the token you generate. You activate the bot using slash commands. All you need to do is type out a message, activate discord developer mode, and copy the message id into any of the three meme generation slash commands in order to turn that text into a meme. You can pick between three available memes (all of which you can find in "meme_folder"): the tumblr drive thru vent meme, the grinch knee surgery meme, and the patrick drooling meme.

## Motivation
After using a lot of discord bots with close friends, I wanted to make my own quote bot that would be even funnier by adding memes instead of just immortalizing funny quotes alone. I wanted to dive into how these bots really work, as well as use javascript for a type of project that I've never really seen before. Finally, another reason why I was interested in this project was because I wanted to dive further into how requests and clients work.

## Challenges and Reflection
Due to the lack of widespread documentation on discord.js, I found it incredibly difficult to implement features for the bot outside of what I learned from the tutorial I was following. It took me a long time to research a solution to things like getting a message's content from an input id, and there were some adjustments I wanted to make that I never did simply because I couldn't find much information on them elsewhere (plus I don't like using ai to code). Nevertheless, I grew a lot in my understanding of how javascript works, as well as simply becoming more "fluent" in the language.
